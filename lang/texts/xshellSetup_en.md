# Xshell setup

To use Xshell as your terminal, you can connect it to the XPipe SSH bridge. This can work automatically once the local bridge ssh key has been added to Xshell with the correct name.

The only thing you have to do manually is to add the private key file `%s` to Xshell with the fixed name `%s`.
