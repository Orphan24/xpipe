## Shell connection gateways

If enabled, XPipe first opens a shell connection to the gateway system and from there opens a PSSession connection to the specified host. WinRM must be enabled and configured on your chosen gateway. This will solely use the configuration of the gateway system relating to WinRM and PSSessions.
