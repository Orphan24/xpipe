# Security 

Due to its nature, XPipe has to handle a lot of sensitive information. Therefore, the security, integrity, and privacy of your data has topmost priority.

More information about the security approach of the XPipe application can be found on the documentation website at https://docs.xpipe.io/reference/security.

You can report security vulnerabilities in this GitHub repository in a confidential manner. We will get back to you as soon as possible if you do.
